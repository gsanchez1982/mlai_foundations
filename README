This is my Portfolio Project for Codecademy "Machine Learning / AI Engineering Foundations" Course.

This project will showcase my Data Analytics skills using Python, Pandas, dataframes and databases, Jupyter Notebooks, and other tools.

Project Scope:

The goals of this project will be to analyze the relationship between the win-record of Club Tigres UANL,
a soccer team which competes in the First Division of Mexico, and the playtime of their star player: Andre-Pierre Gignac.

I will create a table which will record each of the matches Tigres has played in LigaMX since the start of 2017 (about 240 or so).
This table will be a list of tuples: One of the values will record whether Tigres played home ("H") or away ("A"),
and the other value will be the result, whether the match was won, tied, or lost.

I will analyze whether there is a relationship between playing at home and wins.

The table will be created from the livescore-api.com API relevant to LigaMX.
Since I'll be on the free version of this API, I will create a python script that can create the table,
save the table to a different file, and then create another script to do the analysis.
