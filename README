This is my Portfolio Project for Codecademy "Machine Learning / AI Engineering Foundations" Course.

This project will showcase my Data Analytics skills using Python, Pandas, dataframes and databases, Jupyter Notebooks, and other tools.

Project Scope:

The goals of this project will be to analyze the relationship between the win-record of Club Tigres UANL,
a soccer team which competes in the First Division of Mexico, and the playtime of their star player: Andre-Pierre Gignac.

I will create a table which will record each of the last 500 matches Tigres has played in all competitions.
This table will have an identifier, the name of the opposing team, whether the match was won, tied, or lost, and how many minutes Gignac played.
If Gignac did not play, then it will record 0 minutes.

I will analyze whether a longer amount of minutes played by Gignac correlates to wins.

Some of this information may not be available in table form, so I will require to manually create the table in some cases.
I will use Microsoft Excel for this task.
